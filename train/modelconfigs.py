"""
This file contains a bunch of configs for models of different sizes.
See the bottom of this file "base_config_of_name" for a dictionary of all the different
base model architectures, and which ones are recommended of each different model size.

For each base model, additional configs are also pregenerated with different suffixes.

For example, for b10c384nbt, we also have models like:
b10c384nbt-mish  (use mish instead of relu)
b10c384nbt-bn-mish-rvgl (use batchnorm, mish, and repvgg-linear-style convolutions).

KataGo's main models for the distributed training run currently find the following to work
well or best: "-fson-mish-rvgl-bnh"
* Use fixed activation scale initialization + one batch norm for the whole net
* Mish activation
* Repvgg-linear-style convolutions
* Batch norm output head + non-batch-norm output head, where the former drives optimization
  but the latter is used for inference.

Version=15 by default, "-v11" or "-v102" to set the version to 11 or 102. 

For transformers, the recommended settings are "-bng-silu"
for example: b14c192h6tfrs-bng-silu
Transformer models should be exported by export_onnx.py
